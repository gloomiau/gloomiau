_I'm mostly online when talking to **Loveine**, so i might not notice if you talk to me thru public chat. I have low social battery and sudden mood swings that may affect social interactions as well._

_If I disappear outta nowhere, I'm just overwhelmed or my phone died. I might come back later, or not. I apologize._

_I have some stuff going on w my head, i'd rather not specify anything but please be aware **I can only function in a specific way** and I will be avoiding you if I feel too out of my comfort zone / too unsafe._

_please **DNI** if you're gonna RP w me , if you like incest and lolisho or if you're a double ( **Another Azul riako / yume** )_
